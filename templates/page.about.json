        "body_text": "<p>In 1955, Shri C. Velayutha Nadar and his wife, V. Lakshmi Thai, began their journey with a simple dream — to share the joy of authentic South Indian sweets and snacks with their community. With nothing more than a humble food cart on the lively streets of Sivakasi — a city famous for its fireworks and safety matches — they crafted every delicacy by hand, using traditional recipes and pure ingredients. Their dedication, honesty, and love for good food soon made their creations a local favourite, turning customers into family.</p><p>As the years passed, their five sons carried forward this legacy, upholding the same values of taste, purity, and tradition. From the crunch of our signature Sivakasi Pakkoda to our wide range of karam savouries bursting with bold flavours, every bite continued to tell the story of our roots.</p><p>Today, as a proud fourth-generation business, C. Velayuthanadar Sweets & Snacks stands as a symbol of trust and tradition. With multiple outlets across Sivakasi and a growing presence beyond, we continue to serve the same love and authenticity that began seven decades ago — one sweet, one savoury, and one smile at a time.</p>",
