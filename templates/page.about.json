Velayutha Nadar Sweets is more than a sweets brand  it’s a story of humble beginnings, lasting values, and a taste that generations have loved.</p><p>Our journey began in 1955, when Shri C. Velayutha Nadar and his wife Smt. V. Lakshmi Thai started selling homemade sweets and snacks from a wheel cart in the heart of Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu — a town famous for its firework and safety match industries.</p><p>Locals fondly called it “ThattuKadai”, meaning street-side cart — a name that came to represent simplicity, quality, and unmatched flavour.</p><p>After Shri C. Velayutha Nadar’s passing, the family honored his legacy by officially naming the business ThattuKadai C. Velayutha Nadar Sweets. Today, the brand proudly continues under the guidance of the fourth generation, staying true to the original recipes and values.</p>",
